## Description

This is my capstone project for neuefische web development bootcamp.

Have you ever stood in front of a product at your local grocery store and asked yourself if you've tried that product before and if you did, whether you actually liked it?
This is where this app comes in: save your favorite (and least favorite) food products with a rating along with some recipes, so the next time you ask yourself whether you actually liked that product, you know where to find the answer.

## Demo
